# Confectionery


## What is Confectionery?

Confectionery is a library of rules for the [Conftest](https://www.conftest.dev/) tool. These rules can be used to detect misconfigurations in Terraform plans and other configuration file formats. The terraform rules also leverage the [Regula](https://github.com/fugue/regula) library to assist with the parsing of Terraform plans. 

By creating rules for the Conftest tool, misconfigurations can be caught earlier in the development cycle by being rule-locally or as part of a CI/CD pipeline. This helps prevent the introduction of the misconfiguration into the runtime environment. For example, you can ensure any resource deployed is on the allowed list of services. 

Confectionery helps enforce governance expectations and provides a fast feedback loop for developers. 

## Getting Started

To use Confectionery you must first [install Conftest](https://www.conftest.dev/install/)

### Generating the terraform plan json

``terraform init``

``terraform plan -out tf-plan.binary ``

``terraform show -json tf-plan.binary > tf-plan.json``


The following command will place the rego rules into a directory called ``policy`` in the directory it is run from. It will then validate the plan. It will only download if the files have changed 

``conftest test --update "git::https://github.com/cigna/confectionery.git//rules/terraform?ref=<tagged-version>" tf-plan.json``

You can override the location the rules are stored with path option below. This should be useful for caching

``conftest test -p test/ --update "git::https://github.com/cigna/confectionery.git//rules/terraform?ref=<tagged-version>" tf-plan.json``

To see available tags please click on [Releases](https://github.com/cigna/confectionery/releases).

### How to Use Exceptions

If it is necessary to temporarily suppress a rule while waiting for a fix to be added to the library, or a non-fixable false-positive exists then exceptions can be used. We have adopted Regula's feature for exceptions which is referenced [here](https://github.com/fugue/regula#waiving-rule-results).

When using exceptions with Conftest, the `test` command can be modified to the following format

``conftest test -p policy -p exceptions --update "git::https://github.com/cigna/confectionery.git//rules/terraform?ref=<tagged-version>" tf-plan.json``

The additional ``-p`` argument would be used to specify the path to an additional directory which houses the necessary file

A sample ``config.rego`` can be seen below. Multiple rules can be specified, and the waiver/exception can be limited to certain resources. Please refer to the regula link above for the the full list of supported filters. Rule names can be found on the first line of the relevant rule rego file after ``rules.`` in the package name.

```
package fugue.regula.config

waivers[waiver] {
    waiver := {
        "rule_name": "<rule name goes here>",
    } 
} {    
    waiver := {
        "rule_name": "<second rule name here>",
    }
}
```

## Creating Rules
To get started creating rules follow along with this [rules overview](rules/README.md).
